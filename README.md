## Description

This page is a portfolio for myself. I will be adding to this page through-out the bootcamp as I learn new concepts, but for now this page consists of basic HTML & css to showcase my understanding of the fundamentals. 

The page consists of
- A head containing navigation links to the rest of the page.
- An about me section with some information about myself.
- A section containing my work (for the moment only consists of my week 1 homework)
- A section containing information on where to contact me.
- A footer to mark the end of the page

This has helped me in understanding the 'flex' property in order to align different elements in HTML. This has also help my understanding of psuedo-classes in CSS.
