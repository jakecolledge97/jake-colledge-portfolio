## Description

This page is a portfolio for myself. I will be adding to this page through-out the bootcamp as I learn new concepts, but for now this page consists of basic HTML & css to showcase my understanding of the fundamentals. 

The old page consists of
- A head containing navigation links to the rest of the page.
- An about me section with some information about myself.
- A section containing my work (for the moment only consists of my week 1 homework)
- A section containing information on where to contact me.
- A footer to mark the end of the page

The new page is animated, when the first button is pressed the pages will build itself and type out the information infront of the user. This can be skill by navigating to a part of the page with the hamburger in the top left corner.
